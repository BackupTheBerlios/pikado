Building an ANSI build of wxWidgets
-----------------------------------

=> This special library is only needed for the old pikado software which was never public released.

- Install the build dependencies for wxWidgets: (compiler, various libraries etc.)
  $ sudo apt-get build-dep libwxgtk2.8-0

- Download the latest stable source release of wxWidgets 2.8 from www.wxwidgets.org
  => wxGTK-2.8.10.tar.gz
  => gsockgtk.cpp (patch for newer GTK versions)

- Extract the source archive and copy the gsockgtk.cpp file into the directory: "src/gtk/"

- Compile the library (inside the "wxGTK-2.8.10" directory)
  $ mkdir build_gtk
  $ cd build_gtk
  $ ../configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
